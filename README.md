# Ultrasonic-Navigation
Shoes that help blind people climb stairs and navigate around obstacles in their home.

Ultrasonic sensors on the feet measure and relay the distance to an obstacle to a speaker on the wrist that
  tells the user the direction of the object.
 
Special sensor positions were used to make the device capable of differentiating between and ascending and 
  descending staircase, and then inform the user.
  
Users had the option of switching from the speaker to a set of vibration discs that vibrated in the direction of the obstacle.
